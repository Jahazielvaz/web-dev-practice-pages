<h2>TAGS THAT SURVIVED THE CSS REVOLUTION</h2>

<p>
&lt;em&gt; and &lt;i&gt; both italizise the text they're applied to. Example:

	<ul>
		<li><em>This sentence has been italiziced using &lt;em&gt;</em></li>
		<br>
		<li><i>While this sentence has been Italiziced using the &lt;i&gt; element</i></li>
	</ul>
<br>
&lt;bold&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; both make the text bold. Example:
		
	<ul>
		<li><b>This sentence has been made bold using the &lt;b&gt; element</b></li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>While this sentence has been made bold using the &lt;strong&gt; element</strong></li>
	</ul>

</p>

<p>The above mentioned elements are considered to be styling and semantic elements.</p>

<p>
	Both the &lt;i&gt; and the &lt;b&gt; tags are style tags.
	<br>
	Both the &lt;em&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt; tags are considered semantic.
	<br>
	The difference is that the style tags only serve the purpose of styling the text, while the semantic tags drive the point accross. This matters, specially in voice browsers and screen readers, which rely on translating written language into words. 
</p>

<p>
	In HTML5 the 2 style tags mentioned above were brought back, but this time with some semantic meaning of their own; however, the meaning is different. 

	In order to save the redundance, it's best if you read the article <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2017/courseware/7e7a7ad104714c61b5b7bd35048b9ddc/dd9cc2d025bc4ac5b1a66481aac0db1b/?child=first">here</a> for more details and rules concerning these four tags.

	I have to leave soon, but it's very important that we study <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2017/courseware/7e7a7ad104714c61b5b7bd35048b9ddc/dd9cc2d025bc4ac5b1a66481aac0db1b/?child=first">this section.</a> As it talks about the basic structure of a web page. In fact, <strong>you have homework:</strong> Your homework is to click the link attached to <q>this section</q> above.
	and then create a web page from scratch using that very structure. Find a topic, draw it out, and then get to work on it. Make sure you create a whole separate folder for it.
