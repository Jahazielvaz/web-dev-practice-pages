		<li>While tags are not case sensitive, <em>keep them case sensitive</em>, <mark style="background-color:green; color:white;"> so your code can be read easily.</mark></li>
		<li>Open and close tags, should always match.</li>
		<li>Use indentation effectively so that other programers can see clusters of code and compartmentalize.</li>
		<li>Use consisten quotation strings.</li>
		<li>Use the commments to create sections, for things to be easier to be found.</li>
		<li>Distinguishing ids solely by case sensitivity is really bad practice</li>
		<li>Be consistent with your quotes.</li>

		<li>White spaces in html don't count, so it's up to you to find your organizational style using white spaces.</li>
		<li>Elements are not case sensitive, but CSS declarations, class, ids, and over all identifiers are.</li>
		<li>String are just a series of characters: These could include text, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.</li>
		<li>Strings usually go in quotation marks, but for example when you're using CSS, html will usually include them for you. These next 2 methods are valid: &lt;p id=myName&gt;, &lt;p id=&quot;myName&quot;&gt;, and &lt;p id=&apos;myName&apos;&gt;, are all equivalent.</li>
		<li>In html double quotes, and single quotes(also known as apostrophes) are almost interchangeable, but they have to match.</li>
		<li>Once you assing the double of the single quote, html won't close it, until it sees the same style of quote. This is useful because you can include quotation marks as part of your text</li>
