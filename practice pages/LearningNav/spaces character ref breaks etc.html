<h3>CHARACTER REFFERENCES</h3>

<P>
	&lt;div&gt;
	<hr>
	&#60;html&#62;
	note that the &lt;br&gt; will add a break to your page, like this:
	<br>
	you can add multiple breaks by using multiple &lt;br&gt; elements in a row, like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	You can add a space to your page. Using your character refferences, like this:

	&nbsp;
	This particular method will allow you to add as many spaces as you want. like this:
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	Using the conventional method will make it so that the browser deletes all but one.

<!--REMEMBER THAT THE <em> TAG ALLOWS YOU TO EMPHASIZE A WORD OR A SENTENCE-->

<!--ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE <mark> TAG ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF SPECIFIC LETTERS OR SENTENCES.-->
<!--YOU CAN ALSO USE MARK IN CSS BY SIMPLY ADDING IT AS YOU WOULD THE BODY. YOU CAN ASSIGN A SPECIFIC COLOR TO IT BY ADDING THE STYLE TAG INSIDE THE MARK TAG. OR OTHERWISE IF YOU LEAVE THE MARK TAG BLANK, IT'LL DEFAULT TO YELLOW.-->

<!-- HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW-->

<P>
	First we're going to try out the emphasize using the &lt;em&gt; element. We're highilighting <em>&quot;this sentence&quot;</em>
	<br>
	<br>
	Second we're going to use the default highlighter by just adding the &lt;mark&gt; element to <mark>&quot;THIS SENTENCE&quot;</mark>
	<br>
	<br>
	Third, we're going to use the &lt;mark&gt; element to highlight the background of a sentence, by using the &lt;style&gt; element inside the &lt;mark&gt; element. here it goes: <mark style="background-color:blue; color:#fff" >&quot;WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING THIS SENTENCE&quot;</mark>
	<br>
	<br>
	Finally, We're going to use the CSS on the &lt;mark&gt; element. We're marking <mark>&apos;THIS SENTENCE.&apos;</mark>
