<h3>CHARACTER REFFERENCES</h3>

<P>
	&lt;div&gt;
	<hr>
	&#60;html&#62;
	note that the &lt;br&gt; will add a break to your page, like this:
	<br>
	you can add multiple breaks by using multiple &lt;br&gt; elements in a row, like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	You can add a space to your page. Using your character refferences, like this:

	&nbsp;
	This particular method will allow you to add as many spaces as you want. like this:
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&#160;
	Using the conventional method will make it so that the browser deletes all but one.
	<br>
	<br>
	You can also use quotes by using the character refferences, like this:
	&quot;type text&quot; As in all other character refferences, you also have the numerical ref. which in this case is this: &#34;type-text&#34;
	<br>
	<br>
	Here's an example if you want to display the source elements, using refferences:
	&lt;a href=&quot;&num;timetable&quot;&gt;
	<br>
	<br>
	Ok so now here's your exam. You're going to try to display the image element by using refferences, all on your own:
	<br>
	<img src="images/test.png" alt="test image"/>
	&lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; alt=&quot;test image&quot;&gt;
	<br>
	<br>
	Since the ampersand "&amp;" is the special character to display special characters, some browsers will allow you to use it directly, but not all. So you also need to encode it, in order to make sure it's foolproof. This is how you make sure it's always displayed:
	&amp;
	<br>
	<br>
	Here's an example of the reasons why you will want to make sure you always use the character refferences when you need to display them, even when you encounter a browser that will display them without their appropriate refference:
	<br>
	<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language "5"">HTML5</abbr>
	<br>
	So you're going to notice that if you hover your mouse over the above example HTML5 the 5 won's show up, but if you hover it over the bottom example it will. 
	<br>
	<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language &quot;5&quot;">HTML5</abbr>
	<br>
	<br>
	Keep in mind that the &lt;em&gt; element serves to emphasize parts of a paragraph, or entire paragraphs. Here's an example:
	<br>
	Here you notice that the word <em>awesome</em> is the most important, and that's why it stands out. The &lt;em&gt; element determines that.
