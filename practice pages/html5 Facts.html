<h3>Tooltips</h3>
A message that appears when you point your cursor at something is called a tooltip. Be it a paragraph, header, image or any element, the title attribute is used to provide additional information about it. It is very useful to elaborate abbreviations or add some context. For images, you must use an alt attribute as there is no guarantee that the title attribute is presented to assistive technology users. The title can be of any text <abbr title="The value attribute specifies the value of an &lt;input&gt; element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For <q>button</q>, <q>reset</q>, and <q>submit</q> - it defines the text on the button
For <q>text</q>, <q>password</q>, and <q>hidden</q> - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For <q>checkbox</q>, <q>radio</q>, <q>image</q> - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)">value.</abbr>

Example: <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
